Advanced Help -

In this game, there are 3 primary gamemodes(Challenge, Multiplayer, and Single Player).

-=-=CHALLENGE=-=-

This is a timed gamemode.

You have 60 seconds to guess as many of the presented words as possible. It uses the same process to select a random word from the Word List as the Singleplayer gamemode.

If you guess the word incorrectly, you lose and must press either RESTART or MAIN MENU to try again.

If you guess the word correctly, then you gain a point and a new word is presented to you.

At the end of the 60 seconds, no more words will be presented and you can press RESTART to get a better score.


-=-=MULTIPLAYER=-=-

This is a 2-person local gamemode.

Before beginning, you must split up to fill individual roles. One of you will be the guesser, the other will create the word.

To start, the person who chose to be the WORD CREATOR will input an UNKNOWN(Atleast one that the WORD GUESSER doesnt know) word into the field, and press START. 

The person who chose to be the WORD GUESSER will then use the presented WORD INFORMATION to try and guess the word that the WORD CREATOR came up with.

If they guess it correctly, the screen will light up green and you will be presented with the option to play again.

To play correctly, you would then proceed to switch roles (GUESSER -> CREATOR, CREATOR -> GUESSER)

Whoever takes the lowest amount of guesses to get the word correctly WINS(Judged on your own).


-=-=SINGLEPLAYER=-=-

This is a 1-person, untimed gamemode.

You will immediately be presented with WORD INFORMATION that you can use to create your guess on what the word could be. 

If you guess correctly, by inputting your guess into the field and pressing GUESS!, then the screen will light up green.

If you guess incorrectly, by inputting your guess into the field and pressing GUESS!, then the screen will light up red and you WILL be able to guess again.

If you get stuck, then you can press REVEAL to show you the word.

If you wish to restart, you can press RESET to get a new word.

(WARNING: Pressing REVEAl and RESTART will reset your points! Use carefully!)
